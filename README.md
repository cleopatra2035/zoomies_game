# Zoomies
## Background
*Zoomies* is a game inspired by Google Chrome's offline Dino game. You are Cleopatra the Hacker, mother of the Instagram-famous ridiculously-adorable pitbull Coki. You just spent all day programming at your computer and decide to take Coki for a well-deserved walk, but Coki decides it's a great time for zoomies instead! Your mission is to catch Coki before he knocks over your precious plant collection.

This game will use JavaScript ES6 and HTML5 Canvas.

- [ ] Start the game by clicking the screen or pressing any key
